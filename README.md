## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Queries
- Vanilla JS

### Challenges

- `Burger menu:` This is my first time making a burger menu, i made it with my logic to make a toggle and addEventListener the toggle then display the ul, i did as follow and it worked great the only problem i faced is the menu just display without any animation, it wasn't good, so i did some research and i found that i can make the ul `position:fixed` and `top: -100%` this way you can give it a transition and have some animation instead of just a `display: none`
- `The backgound color:` It was difficult to make it responsive. How did i fixed that? well i didn't i just had to deal with every break point and fix the positions
